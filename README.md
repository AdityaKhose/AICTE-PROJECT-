# *PROJECT NAME* :- HealthLens Predictor – AI Based Symptom Analysis System

*DESCRIPTION* :- The Disease Prediction System is an AI-powered healthcare solution designed to assist medical professionals and patients by predicting potential diseases based on user symptoms. This project leverages machine learning algorithms, primarily classification models such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), to analyze patterns in patient data and provide accurate predictions. The system processes user-input symptoms, medical history, and demographic information to generate probable diagnoses, helping in early detection and timely intervention.
For data handling and model training, Python was used alongside libraries like pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization. The user interface is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring an interactive and user-friendly experience for patients and healthcare providers. The project incorporates data cleaning, feature selection, and model evaluation techniques to ensure reliable predictions, while continuous learning allows the model to improve as more data is collected.
